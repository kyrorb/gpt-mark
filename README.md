# gpt-mark

GPT-Mark is a tool designed to ease students revision and also lighten the workload for teachers when it comes to marking long answers that their students have written.

GPT-Mark uses **GPT3** to allow the user to input their answer, and then we will look for this question against the many markschemes we have.

Using this, we can provide a free way for students to get their work marked and potentially even have feedback given to them.

Credits go to OpenAI for providing the GPT-3 model.
